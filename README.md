# simple-java-calculator
A very barebones calculator written in Java.

ver_0.1

known issues

-It prioritizes multiplication and division but deletes the rest of the expression (ie: 2+3*6 will calculate only 3*6)

-It does not allow for decimal inputs (allows for results)

-Very big numbers won't round (they are shown but continue off-screen)
